# Quantum/Qiu First Principles

Initial aim to perform the following calculations for a molecular system:

- DFT
- DFPT
- GW
- BSE
- ESD
- Wannier
- Polaron models

Then, crystal systems, symmetry, and parallelization will be considered. The main goal is to experiment, learn from simplifying the code, and test out new ideas.
